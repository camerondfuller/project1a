# Aloha Homepage Project

Summary -
This is a fake e-commerce website for the Aloha Clothing Co. It was create from scratch to understand how to work with the HTML DOM and box model, and CSS specificity.

Tools and methods used to build site:
- HTML/CSS
- Responsive/mobile first design
- Eric Meyer Reset
- Git

Experience from the project:
This project introduced me to working with HTML and CSS. Previously I had a very shallow understanding of HTML, and didn't know how to even link a stylesheet or what CSS classes or IDs were. While the site is simple in design, this project taught me the basics that even great developers use. This has been an invaluable project.
Some key take aways include understanding z-index, linear gradients, strong and em tags, headings and sections.
